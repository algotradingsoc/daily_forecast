Triple Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters)
  1. Overall smoothing
  2. Trend smoothing 
  3. Seasonal smoothing
  
Assumption: Apart from normal smoothing, stock prices are affected by trend (momentum) and seasonal patterns (greater demand in December?)

Data needed: Any equity daily close price (e.g AAPL) or market index daily close price (e.g SPX)

Python package: statsmodel 
https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.tsa.holtwinters.ExponentialSmoothing.html

Approach: Fit Holt-Winters model using a single time-frame to get out regressors for forecasting

Improvements: Compare triple exponential smoothing model with double/single exponential smoothing model to see which has the better fit
Use ML to regress model at different time periods
